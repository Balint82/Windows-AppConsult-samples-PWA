## Add Ink support to your PWAs with the Edge Canvas Control

Requires: Microsoft EdgeHTML 17.17134

This sample code demonstrates the inking extensions to the ```<canvas>``` control in Microsoft Edge. This supports all the methods and properties of the InkCanvas class documented here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/uwp/api/windows.ui.xaml.controls.inkcanvas. 

With this control you can provide an enhanced experince to your users when ink input is needed.

Note that this control only works in a Progressive Web App on Windows. Likely youâ€™ll need conditional code to enable the bespoke UI for the extended inking capabilities. See the code for how to detect this.

Note that this requires the Spring 2018 release of Windows 10 (1803) or greater to run.
