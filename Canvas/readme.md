## Add Ink support to your PWAs with the Edge Canvas Control

Requires: Microsoft EdgeHTML 17.17134

This sample code demonstrates the new ```<canvas>``` control (HTML – Edge). This supports all the methods and properties of the InkCanvas class documented here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/uwp/api/windows.ui.xaml.controls.inkcanvas. 

With this control you can provide an enhanced experince to your users when ink input is needed.

Note that this control only works in a Progressive Web App on Windows. Likely you’ll need conditional code to swap between the canvas control and an alternative control. See the code for how to detect this.

Note that until the Spring 2018 release of Windows 10 is available, you'll need an Insider build to run this sample. For information on the Windows Insider program go to http://insider.windows.com
