# Push notifications on Windows 10
This sample shows how a Progressive Web App on Windows can subscribe to push notifications and receive toast and tile notifications from a backend using WNS (Windows Notification Service).

The sample is made by a:

- An ASP.NET Core 2.0 project, which must be deployed on a web server 
- A Progressive Web App project, which should be pointed to the URL where the web application has been deployed
- A Windows Forms app, which acts as a backend and sends push notification to the PWA

This sample has been published as a companion of the following blog post [http://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/appconsult/2018/06/07/push-notifications-in-a-pwa-running-on-windows-10/](http://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/appconsult/2018/06/07/push-notifications-in-a-pwa-running-on-windows-10/)
